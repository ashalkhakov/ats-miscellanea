This is a regexp matching library-in-the-making.

We have written an implementation largely following the approach outlined
in "Regular-expression derivatives reexamined" (by Owens, Reppy, Turon).
The implementation doesn't support Unicode and regular vectors (yet),
but based on a few tests, it seems to work.

We are experimenting with a rewrite that uses linear types and in-place
mutation instead of a purely functional approach taken in the paper
to produce an implementation that is fast and correct (at the expense
of clarity).

The end goal is two-fold:
- to provide a regular expression matching library
- to implement a tool for generating lexical analyzers
