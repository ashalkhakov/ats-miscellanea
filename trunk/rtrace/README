=== 1. Goals ===

The following goals were pursued for this project:

* give the author a refresher on computer graphics, especially
visualization by tracing rays ("to understand is to implement")

* see if ATS is up to the task (in particular, I wanted to apply
abstract data types, linear and dependent types, and other typeful
programming facilities as present in ATS in the setting of computer
graphics visualization)

* design and implement a modular off-line raytracer; use sound
principles gathered from many nice people [1] in writing a specification
all the way down to writing the code against it

=== 2. Results ===

Here are some results for the first version:

* implemented a naive BVH that uses top-down in-place partitioning
of input by median split along longest axis

* many properties of the code that I find vital are formally verified
by the ATS type system (e.g., correct use of resources). In particular,
both linear and dependent types proved to be invaluable

* the core of ray tracer (the implementation of BVH) was written in the
time span of 1 working day and produced expected results the first time
it was ran

* modules and abstract types make it much easier to isolate parts of program,
so that future modification is indeed less of a hassle; no breakage
ensued when I changed the underlying implementations of abstract types
(e.g., it wasn't an issue to supplant a naive O(n^2) implementation
of scene with the BVH code)

=== 3. Wishlist ===

The following is a list of what I'd like to do next:

* proper profiling and benchmarking

* tracing of meshes

* high-level optimization, then low-level optimization (one that takes
into account the specifics of hardware that runs the program)

=== 4. Building ===

Issue "make release" in the current directory for a release build.
Alternatively, specifying the following targets gives, respectively:
- debug: debug build
- typecheck: typechecking only

This code was tested and found to work on ATS/Anairiats-0.2.3
and GCC 4.4.5 under Ubuntu 10.10.
