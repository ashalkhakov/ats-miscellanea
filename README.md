# ATS/Anairiats miscellanea

This folder contains packages I wrote that might be useful to the ATS
community. All code is licensed under LGPL v3.

* `dlseg` doubly-linked list segments
* `hacks` various small examples
  * `arith.dats` formalization of elementary arithmetic relations
  * `lc.dats` untyped lambda calculus
  * `interp.dats` typeful evaluator for extended simply-typed lambda calculus
* `rtrace` a simple ray caster making heavy use of linear types ([photo](rtrace/TEST/bvh4.jpg))
* `regex` regular expression matcher based on [Regular-expression derivatives reexamined](www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/re-deriv.pdf)
* `thesis` contains my BA thesis (with full source code) -- note that
  I *did* miss my deadline (couldn't finish the whole REPL thing
  within the allocated time... but at least the core of the work, the
  *typeful interpreter* was done)
